IOS and Android mobile authentication app. 

React-native setup from your production folder.

install and/or update Xcode on IOS system.
from Browser goto brew.sh
	a. copy url below install Homewbrew
	b. paste url in terminal command line and hit enter.
	c. run brew update
terminal line -> brew install node 
see if node is installed type -> node -v
terminal command line -> brew install watchman.
terminal command line -> npm install -g react-native-cli
 -> mkdir react-auth (or what folder name you want)
 -> react-native init react-auth
 -> cd react-auth
 to build the site files -> react-native run-ios   (this can take some time)
 Once the first build has been complete and alternative way would be: from command line -> npm start and then from xcode goto open developer tools/simulator. this will open a mobile app window.
